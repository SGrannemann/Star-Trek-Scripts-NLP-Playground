# Star-Trek-Scripts-NLP-Playground
## Project as a training ground for different aspects of NLP



The _use cases_ that are currently planned are:
- Query options via TFIDF and LSA on the scripts and the plot descriptions from Wikipedia.
- Data analysis on the script data: Most frequent speaker, who says what? etc.
- A "Guess the speaker" game where you can input phrases or words and get back the most likely speaker for those words.

The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/gjbroughton/start-trek-scripts
